This is a fork of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Mini-AMF/">Mini-AMF</a> that uses up to date dependencies (ex: importlib.resources instead of setuptools' pkg_resource). Python 2 support has been completely removed because 1) you should not be using it anymore and 2) importlib.resources was added in python 3.7 so there is no way to support it anyways without major backporting work. This is meant to be used with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/as3lib/">as3lib</a> but can be used without it.
